# Two_diced_pig-game
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- Players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next          player's turn.
- The first player to reach the winning score(in case it has been set prior the beginning of the game) or 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
